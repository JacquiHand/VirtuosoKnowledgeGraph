  oplpress:hasSituationAnalysis """Situation Analysis Exponential growth of the Internet and World Wide Web continue to
  						   challenge the data-driven pursuit of agility by enterprises and individuals alike. Today,
  						   as has been the case for many years, data silo proliferation increasingly reduces the utility
  						   of existing productivity tools (such as spreadsheets, business intelligence report writers, document
  						   editors, development environments, and others) as well as a new generation of mobile applications running
  						   on smartphones, tablets, and wearables (e.g., wrist watches) while also increasing data access, integration,
  						   and dissemination costs."""@en ;
  oplpress:hasBody """OpenLink Software, Inc., an innovative technology leader in high performance data access,
  			  integration, virtualization, and native data management, today introduced a new collection of
  			  high-performance, secure, and cross-platform drivers for Open Database & Open Data Connectivity
  			  that turn the World Wide Web into a federated relational database that's accessible from any existing
  			  ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, or OLE DB compliant application or service.

  			  The new LOD Cloud Connectivity Drivers, a client-only component of OpenLink Virtuoso, delivers an unrivalled
  			  data access driver solution that turns any Virtuoso instance (Personal, Enterprise, or Cloud-hosted) into a
  			  powerful data-junction-box for the World Wide Web, providing federated access to the massive data resources of
  			  the World Wide Web and its Linked Open Data enclave.

  			  In this new data access frontier, hundreds of data sources (including Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and LinkedIn)
  			  become directly accessible by ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, and OLE DB compliant tools, through the same familiar interfaces
  			  used to access SQL RDBMS-hosted databases provided by the likes of Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2, Sybase, Informix,
  			  Ingress, Progress, MySQL, and many others."""@en ;
  oplpress:hasQuote """Exposing the World Wide Web as a federated relational [Tables & Property Graphs] database,

  oplpress:hasHeadLine "OpenLink Unleashes Update To Semantically-Aware Column-Store For Handling Big Data Challenges"@en ;
  oplpress:hasSubHeadLine """Virtuoso 7.2 Enhances Massively Scalable Hybrid (Relational Tables & RDF Property/Predicate Graphs)
  					 DBMS For Secure, High-Performance, Big Data Management and Integration Challenges."""@en ;
  oplpress:hasBody """OpenLink Software, Inc., today unveiled the latest, most advanced version of the Virtuoso hybrid data management system,
  			  further expanding their cost-effective, secure, cross-platform, high-performance, and massively-scalable solution to the
  			  challenge of performing and disseminating insightful analytics over Big, Small, and Diverse Data. This latest product release
  			  delivers record setting performance, scalability, and agility, alongside unrivaled security sophistication.
  			  Major Updates include:
  			  Enhanced 3rd Party Storage Services Integration -- 3rd Party Storage Services (e.g., Dropbox, Amazon S3, Microsoft OneDrive,
  			  Google Drive, Box, Rackspace, etc.) are mountable and un-mountable (asynchronously) to Virtuoso's HTTP/WebDAV based File Server
  			  layer. This feature enables end-user level exploitation of open standards for Web-scale Verifiable Identity (e.g., PKIX) that no
  			  longer depend on domain ownership.
  			  Loosely-coupled CSV document support -- Attachment of external, filesystem-hosted CSV Documents to Virtuoso frees users from confinement
  			  to wholesale import and export. Once attached, these CSV documents are treated like native SQL Tables, thereby enabling powerful transformations
  			  into RDF-based Linked Open Data. Net effect, enhanced data virtualization functionality that enables powerful data integration and transformation
  			   -- without losing the lightweight data definition and manipulation benefits of filesystem-hosted CSV documents.
  			  Loosely-Coupled Data Transformation Services -- Enables use of the HTTP POST method to request asynchronous transformation services to convert a
  			  myriad of structured data sources into RDF-based Linked Open Data, on the fly.
  			  Built-in Nanotation Processor -- Automatic extraction and transformation of digital sentences (using RDF-TURTLE notation) embedded in Email
  			  Messages, Online Discussion Posts, Tweets, Social Media Posts (Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+), HTML Body, and Plain Text documents, into RDF-based
  			  Linked Open Data, which is then stored in the host Virtuoso instance. This feature provides users with the freedom, power, and flexibility to
  			  create structured data wherever and whenever -- as long as the target destination is a content input control that supports the 'plain/text'
  			  content-type.
  			  Loosely-coupled SSL/TLS -- For enhanced security, SSL/TLS version and associated cipher selection is now configurable. Net effect, you can now
  			  explicitly disable the use of specific SSL/TLS versions (e.g., SSL/TLS 3.0, which is susceptible to the POODLE exploit)."""@en ;
  oplpress:hasQuote """Virtuoso 7.2 continues to demonstrate OpenLink's profound understanding of the fundamental challenges impeding the pursuit of agility shared by
   			   individuals and enterprises alike, in regards to big, small, disparately-located, and heterogeneously-shaped data access, integration, and
  			   management -- Kingsley Idehen, Founder & CEO, OpenLink Software"""@en ;
  oplpress:hasQuote """As established technology innovation leaders in these realms, none of these functionality enhancements is delivered without paying special
   			   attention to individual privacy and enterprise security -- alongside unobtrusive implementation -- he added."""@en ;
